# Secure Code Review Checklist

## TLDR;
- [ ] What security vulnerabilities is this code susceptible to?
- [ ] Are authorization and authentication handled in the right way?
- [ ] Is (user) input validated, sanitized, and escaped to prevent security attacks such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection?
- [ ] Is sensitive data like user data, credit card information securely handled and stored?
- [ ] Does this code change reveal some secret information like keys, passwords, or usernames?
- [ ] Is data retrieved from external APIs or libraries checked accordingly?
- [ ] Does error handling or logging expose us to vulnerabilities?
- [ ] Is the right encryption used?

## Input Validation
- [ ] *Inputs*. Are inputs from external sources validated?
- [ ] Is user input validated by testing type, length, format, and range, and by enforcing appropriate limits?
- [ ] Are there flaws in regular expression that cause problems with data validation? 
- [ ] Are exact match approaches used whenever possible? 
- [ ] If exact match is not possible, is the content of string variables checked for only expected values (allowed list)? 
- [ ] If allowed listing is not feasible, are entries rejected that contain inappropriate values such as binary data, escape sequences, and comment characters (block list)?
- [ ] Are XML documents validate against their schemas?
- [ ] Do you see string concatenations for user input? 
- [ ] Are SQL statements dynamically created by using user input?
- [ ] Is data validated on the server side?
- [ ] Is there a strong separation between data and commands?
- [ ] Is there a strong separation between data and client-side scripts?
- [ ] Is contextual escaping used before passing data to SQL, LDAP, OS and third-party commands?
- [ ] http headers are validated for each request (e.g. referrer)

## Authentication and User Management
- [ ] Are sessions handled correctly?
- [ ] Are failure messages for invalid usernames or passwords leak information?
- [ ] Are invalid passwords logged (which can leak sensitive pwd & user name combinations)?
- [ ] Are the pwd requirements (lengths/complexity) appropriated?
- [ ] Are invalid login attempts correctly handled with lockouts, and rate limit?
- [ ] Does the "forgot pwd" routine leak information, vulnerable to spamming, or is the pwd send in plain text via email?
- [ ] How and where are pwd and usernames stored, and are appropriate mechanisms such as hashing, salts, encryption in place?

## Authorization
- [ ] Is authentication and authorization the first logic executed for each request?
- [ ] Are authorization checks granular (page and directory level)?
- [ ] Is access to pages and data denied by default?
- [ ] Is re-authenticate for requests that have side-effects enforced?
- [ ] Are there clearly defined roles for authorization?
- [ ] Can authorization be circumvented by parameter manipulation?
- [ ] Can authorization be bypassed by cookie manipulation?

## Session Management
- [ ] Are session parameters passed in URLs?
- [ ] Do session cookies expire in a reasonably short time?
- [ ] Are session cookies encrypted?
- [ ] Is session data being validated?
- [ ] Is private data in cookies kept to a minimum?
- [ ] Does the application avoid excessive cookie use?
- [ ] Is the session id complex?
- [ ] Is the session storage secure?
- [ ] Does the application properly handle invalid session ids?
- [ ] Are session limits e.g., inactivity timeouts enforced?
- [ ] Are logouts invalidating the session?
- [ ] Are session resources released when session invalidated?

## Encryption & Cryptography
- [ ] Are the encryption algorithms used state-of-the art and compliant with standards such as FIPS-140?
- [ ] Minimum key sizes to be supported
- [ ] What types of data must be encrypted
- [ ] Is sensitive data been secured in memory, storage and transit? 
- [ ] Do restricted areas require SSL? 
- [ ] Is sensitive information passed to/from non-SSL pages?

## Exception Handling
- [ ] Do all methods have appropriate exceptions?
- [ ] Does the error shown to users reveal sensitive information or open us up for attacks, .ie. includes stack trace, ids, etc.? 
- [ ] Does the application fails securely when exceptions occur?
- [ ] Are system errors never shown to users?
- [ ] Are resources released and transactions rolled back when there is an error?
- [ ] Are all user / system actions are logged?
- [ ] Do we make sure that sensitive information is not logged (e.g. passwords)?
- [ ] Do we make sure we have logs or all important user management events (e.g. password reset)?
- [ ] Are unusual activity such as multiple login attempts logged?
- [ ] Do logs have enough detail to reconstruct events for audit purposes?


## Reducing the attack surface
- [ ] Are there any alarms or monitoring to spot if they are accessing sensitive data that they shouldn’t be? This could
apply to all types of users, not only administrators
- [ ] Is the function going to be available to non-authenticated users? If no authentication is necessary for the function
to be invoked, then the risk of attackers using the interface is increased. Does the function invoke a backend task that
could be used to deny services to other legitimate users? E.g. if the function writes to a file, 
or sends an SMS, or causes a CPU intensive calculation, could an attacker write a
script to call the function many times per second and prevent legitimate users access to that task?
- [ ] Are searches controlled? Search is a risky operation as it typically queries the database for some criteria and returns
the results, if attacker can inject SQL into query then they could access more data than intended.
- [ ] Is important data stored separately from trivial data (in DB, file storage, etc). Is the change going to allow unauthenticated
users to search for publicly available store locations in a database table in the same partition as the username/
password table? Should this store location data be put into a different database, or different partition, to reduce the
risk to the database information?
- [ ] If file uploads are allowed, are they be authenticated? Is there rate limiting? Is there a maximum file size for each
upload or aggregate for each user? Does the application restrict the file uploads to certain types of file (by checking
MIME data or file suffix). Is the application is going to run virus checking?
- [ ] If you have administration users with high privilege, are their actions logged/tracked in such a way that they a) can’t
erase/modify the log and b) can’t deny their actions?
- [ ] Are there any alarms or monitoring to spot if they are accessing sensitive data that they shouldn’t be? This could
apply to all types of users, not only administrators.
- [ ] Will changes be compatible with existing countermeasures, or security code, or will new code/countermeasures
need to be developed?
- [ ] Is the change attempting to introduce some non-centralized security code module, instead of re-using or extending 
an existing security module?
- [ ] Is the change adding unnecessary user levels or entitlements that will complicate the attack surface.
- [ ] If the change is storing PII or confidential data, is all of the new information absolutely necessary? There is little value
in increasing the risk to an application by storing the social security numbers of millions of people, if the data is never
used.
- [ ] Does application configuration cause the attack surface to vary greatly depending on configuration settings, and is
that configuration simple to use and alert the administrator when the attack surface is being expanded?
- [ ] Could the change be done in a different way that would reduce the attack surface, i.e. instead of making help items
searchable and storing help item text in a database table beside the main username/password store, providing static
help text on HTML pages reduces the risk through the ‘help’ interface.
- [ ] Is information stored on the client that should be stored on the server?
